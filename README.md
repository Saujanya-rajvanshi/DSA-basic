### checklist 
Perfect, this is a **DSA roadmap image**, so I’ll convert it into a **clean GitHub-style checklist** ✅
Since **GitHub Markdown can’t actually color boxes**, the **best practice** is to use **🔵 blue circle emojis** to visually represent *blue boxes*.

You can **directly paste this into your README.md**.
